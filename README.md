## What is this?

This is a ruleset for [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu). It generates Pump It Up charts that are playable with two feet, from osu! beatmaps. That means no weird twists, spins, or splits are generated.
So if you want to practice [WI-EX-DOC-VA D24](https://youtu.be/Q7lxEz3ibt0?t=156), this is not the place for you.

## Tips

- Keybinds:
```
Q E R Y
 S   G
Z C V N
```
- However, I believe playing with your feet with Autoplay mod is more fun.
- f3 and f4 in-game to change scroll speed. This is a keybind in osu! itself, not a ruleset keybind.
- Experiment with all the mods to generate different patterns.
